# Scientists Who Code Example Repository
## Building Open Environmental Infrastructure with Non-Developer Teams

This repository is a demo/model project for the Scientists Who Code pedagogy, showing how interdisciplinary teams (including researchers, students, and community members without formal programming training) can co-create open, reproducible environmental data science tools.

It’s designed for use in workshops, roundtables, and collaborative projects where participants have mixed programming skill levels and need clear examples of:

- GitHub workflows
- CyVerse & Jupyter Notebook integration
- Documentation best practices
- Ethical, open science principles

## Purpose
Environmental science increasingly relies on code, yet many scientists and community members are not trained as software developers.
This example repository provides:

- A safe, low-stakes space to practice collaborative coding and GitHub usage.
- A template structure for Earth and environmental data science projects.
- A teaching aid for project managers leading mixed-skill, interdisciplinary teams.

## Repository Structure


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lijo8146/scientists_who_code_demo_repo/

    cd scientists-who-code-demo_repo

3. Set up the environment (Conda)

    conda env create -f environment.yml      
    conda activate scientists-who-code

5. Open Jupyter Notebooks
jupyter lab

## Workshop Activities
This repository supports the following hands-on learning activities:

## Basic GitHub Workflow
- Forking, cloning, branching, and pull requests.
- Jupyter Notebook Practice
- Open an existing notebook, run cells, and modify code.
- Adding New Data
- Place data in the /data folder, update documentation.
- Collaborative Documentation
- Edit README.md and create a CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Ethical & Open Science Principles
This demo reinforces:
- Transparency — All code and data are open and documented.
- Inclusivity — Materials are accessible to participants with varying technical backgrounds.
- Reproducibility — Clear setup instructions ensure others can re-run analyses.
- Respect for Indigenous Data Sovereignty — Follow CARE Principles when using Tribal data.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from all skill levels.
See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on:
- Adding notebooks or scripts
- Improving documentation
- Suggesting new features
